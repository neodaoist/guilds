# The Guilds of Sibiu
The Guilds of Sibiu is a mixed reality artwork celebrating the rich history of craft guilds in Transylvania, using a new music web3 primitive — smart scores.

A **smart score** is a provably authentic, scarce, and immutable digital representation of a composer's musical work, built on decentralized web protocols. It is the [autograph score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autograph_(manuscript)) for the 3rd millenium, with one important distinction — the composer receives royalties in perpetuity!

For centuries, collectors and scholars alike have treasured autograph scores written in the composer's hand. These manuscripts have both aesthetic value and historical significance. Some famous examples are [Beethoven's 5th Symphony](https://digital.staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/werkansicht/?PPN=PPN664344127&PHYSID=PHYS_0001) and [Mozart's Requiem](https://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2014/music-continental-books-manuscripts-l14402/lot.199.html).

But when the autograph score for Mozart's Requiem sells at Sotheby's for half a million pounds, his estate receives nothing. How much more impactful could these perpetual royalties be for living composers still working in the field?

The Guilds of Sibiu is a test of the smart score idea — think of it as **Contemporary chamber music** meets **Emerging web3 technology** meets (eventually) **Pen-and-ink illustration**.
