# The Guilds of Sibiu
The Guilds of Sibiu is a mixed reality artwork celebrating the rich history of craft guilds in Transylvania, using a new music web3 primitive — smart scores.

A **smart score** is a provably authentic, scarce, and immutable digital representation of a composer's musical work, built on decentralized web protocols. It is the [autograph score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autograph_(manuscript)) for the 3rd millenium, with one important distinction — the composer receives a percentage of secondary sales in perpetuity!

For centuries, collectors and scholars alike have treasured autograph scores written in the composer's hand. They are both a manuscript with aesthetic value and  historical significance. Some famous examples are B[eethoven's 5th Symphony](https://digital.staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/werkansicht/?PPN=PPN664344127&PHYSID=PHYS_0001) and [Mozart's Requiem](https://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2014/music-continental-books-manuscripts-l14402/lot.199.html).

But when the autograph score for Mozart's Requiem sells for half a million pounds, his estate receives nothing, and these perpetual royalties could be that more impactful for living composers still working in the field.

The Guilds of Sibiu is a test of this smart score idea — think of it as **Contemporary chamber music** meets **Emerging web3 technology** meets (eventually) **Pen-and-ink illustration**.
